# Repository Tools
The world of technical writing is quickly becoming more globalized and less office-based. Companies have many different contributors, including technical writers, developers, QA testers, and more. To keep track of who's contributing what and to ensure smooth collaboration, many companies use a repository tool.  

Repository tools are software applications that let users collaborate remotely, manage changes, and maintain one central hub of digital content.
