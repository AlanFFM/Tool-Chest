# CVS (Concurrent Versions System)
## Vendor
https://cvs.nongnu.org/
## Product Type
Open Source
## Description
CVS is a revision control system that improved upon the earlier RCS (revision control system) by operating as a client-server model (which allows multiple developers to work on a single file simultaneously) and adding support for repository-level change tracking (which allows project managers to better track progress).
## Learning Curve
Although CVS does have many GUIs (graphic user interfaces) that make it easier to use, experienced developers prefer using CLI (command line interface) for CVS, as it provides more flexibility, efficiency, and tool integration. If you are using a GUI, the learning curve varies based on the GUI you are using. If you are using a CLI, it be difficult to learn as a beginner. However, if you have prior experience with using git in a CLI, you may actually find CVS easier to use (as there is only one centralized repository to work with).
