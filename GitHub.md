## Description
GitHub is a platform and cloud-based service for software development and version control that uses Git. It follows a distributed version control model and provides access control, task management, bug tracking, and much more for every project.
## Learning Curve
One method of using GitHub is through GitHub's GUI (graphic user interface). You can easily learn how to use it by taking GitHub's interactive courses that walk you through all the basics.  

Another method of using GitHub is on a CLI (command line interface). This has a steeper learning curve than the GUI and is not as intuitive, but it does provides more features and better help resources.
## Cost

## Operating Systems
GitHub works on various operating systems, including: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
## Advantages
* **Easy-to-Use**  
  CVS uses a centralized system that records the changes to the project in a single file. This provides a much simpler and more straightforward workflow than in a distributed system (with multiple file versions).
* **Binary Files**  
  CVS uses a delta compression system for managing the changes in a file, which works well for large files with few changes (such as binary files).
* **Reliability**  
  CVS has been around for over 30 years and has been reliably used for multiple projects (including many that are open-sourced).
## Disadvantages
* **Connectivity**  
   CVS runs on a single, centralized system. The only way to access a project in the system is by being connected to the network (such as the internet). That means that you cannot work on a project offline.
* **Slow Performance**  
  In CVS, you can only work with individual files (similar to RCS) and are required to make contact with the server for nearly every operation. This can be time-consuming and expensive.
* **Outdated Technology**  
  CVS is an older version control system that has largely been replaced by newer sytems (such as Git and Subversion). Although it is still used in some organizations, it isn't what you want to use if you need new and advanced features.
