**Lot of content**: if itâ€™s a large blog, generating a static website can take up to 15 minutes.  
**Limited Dynamic Content**: Content that changes frequently is had to manage in Gatsby.  
**Complex Environment**: Gatsby requires installing multiple dependencies and plugins, which increases complexity.
